<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">

-	To address the challenges of multi-modal, multi-scenario, and multi-task data acquisition, our lab has developed a VR-based heterogeneous robot integrated data collection system. This system combines various types of robots and sensors to efficiently collect and manage data across diverse environments and tasks.
- It also supports training of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using the collected data, enhancing the agents' perception, understanding, and decision-making capabilities in complex tasks.

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">

-	To address complex demands in high-level cognitive decision-making, we developed a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates visual and tactile feedback. A fine-grained multimodal semantic alignment mechanism enables effective fusion of visual and haptic information, improving the model‚Äôs understanding of environmental and task-specific details. This empowers robotic arms with intelligent decision-making and precise control across diverse scenarios, significantly enhancing execution accuracy and adaptability in complex operations.

<div class='paper-box'><div class='paper-box-image'><div><div class="badge"></div><img src='images/humanoid_migration.gif' alt="sym" style="width:500px; height:auto;"></div></div>
<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">

-	To tackle challenges in low-level motion control, we designed a reinforcement learning-based Sim2Real framework for fast and robust transfer of human-like motions. By bridging simulation and real-world environments, the framework improves motion transfer efficiency and robustness. A hierarchical multi-agent tolerance reinforcement learning method was also proposed, enabling collaborative learning and fault tolerance across different agent levels. This approach accelerates learning and enhances stability and adaptability during transfer.

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">

- To enhance perception and control in dexterous robotic hands, we developed an efficient tactile sensing system by integrating flexible electronic skin with dexterous hand hardware. For different application scenarios, custom tactile sensing and reconstruction algorithms were implemented, improving the accuracy of tactile perception and interpretation. By fusing tactile and visual information, the system significantly strengthens the multimodal perception and autonomous control capabilities of dexterous hands in complex environments.
